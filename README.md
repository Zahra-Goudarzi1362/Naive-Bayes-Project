# Naive-Bayes-Project
we used Naive Bayes Project- in prediction of probility of Diabetes- we used Gaussian Nave Bayes algorithm As all dataset are continuous we can use this algorithmÂ¶
As In our  data set Pregnancies is discrete we should delete this
# At describe code we can see count is the same for all columns, so we donot have any missing value 
Then we made our Naive Bayes model and get Accuracy: 0.7671957671957672
To reach better accuracy we used cross_validation Kfold to see score 
As 0.66 in scores was lower than other score we can delete this section from dataset then we get Accuracy: 0.8410596026490066, which is better. 
Then we enter our new features in our model to predict our target.
